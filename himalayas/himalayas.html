            <p>The Himalayas, or Himalaya is a mountain range in South 
                and East Asia separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent 
                from the Tibetan Plateau. The range has many of Earth's highest 
                peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest, at the border 
                between Nepal and China. The Himalayas include over fifty 
                mountains exceeding 7,200 m (23,600 ft) in elevation, including 
                ten of the fourteen 8,000-metre peaks. By contrast, the highest 
                peak outside Asia (Aconcagua, in the Andes) is 6,961 m (22,838 ft) tall.
                
                Lifted by the subduction of the Indian tectonic plate under the Eurasian Plate, 
                the Himalayan mountain range runs west-northwest to east-southeast in an 
                arc 2,400 km (1,500 mi) long. Its western anchor, Nanga Parbat, lies just 
                south of the northernmost bend of the Indus river. Its eastern anchor, 
                Namcha Barwa, is just west of the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River 
                (upper stream of the Brahmaputra River).
                The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and the 
                Hindu Kush ranges. To the north, the chain is separated from the Tibetan 
                Plateau by a 50–60 km (31–37 mi) wide tectonic valley called the 
                Indus-Tsangpo Suture. 
                Towards the south, the arc of the Himalaya is ringed by the very low 
                Indo-Gangetic Plain. The range varies in width from 350 km (220 mi) in 
                the west (Pakistan) to 150 km (93 mi) in the east (Arunachal Pradesh).
                
                The Himalayas are inhabited by 52.7 million people, and are spread across 
                five countries: Bhutan, China, India, Nepal and Pakistan. 
                The Hindu Kush range in Afghanistan and Hkakabo Razi in Myanmar 
                are normally not included, but they are both (with the addition of Bangladesh) 
                part of the greater Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) river system.
